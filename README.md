# Berkeley Coding Bootcamp Challenge 5
5th coding bootcamp challenge where students were asked to create a work day scheduler. The scheduler displays the current day at the top, and when users
scroll down, they are presented with time blocks for a standard 9am to 5pm
work day schedule. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is
in the past, present, or future. When a user clicks into a time block, they
can enter an event. Each time block has an individual save button that will
save that entry to their local storage.
