# Work Day Scheduler
Keep track of your week by creating, editing, and deleting notes and reminders on a weekly schedule. The scheduler displays the current day at the top, and when users scroll down, they are presented with time blocks for a standard 9am to 5pm work day schedule. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When a user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event. Each time block has an individual save button that will save that entry to their local storage.
